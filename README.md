## Installation

- Unzip the contents of the zip archive into the Moodle `.../lib/editor/tiny/plugins/fontcolor` directory.
- As a Moodle Admin go to Site Administration -> Plugins -> Text Editors -> TinyMCE editor -> Tiny text color/text background color settings
and add a view color names and color codes for at least on of the setting "Available text colors" or "Available text background colors".
- You may also enable the color picker for text color or background color.
 
If no colors are available and the color picker is disabled then the
menu item and button in the TinyMCE editor will not appear. This is valid for both,
the text color setting and the background color setting.

The color name can be an arbitrary string e.g. Red or Dark Green or whatever you name
your color. The name can be also the "corporate name" e.g. that is used in any style guides
of the corporate identity at your institution.
